    para1: `The heart-shaped silhouette of the strawberry is the first clue that
        this fruit is good for you. These potent little packages protect your
        heart, increase HDL (good) cholesterol, lower your blood pressure, and
        guard against cancer.`,
    para2: `Packed with vitamins, fiber, and particularly high levels of
          antioxidants known as polyphenols, strawberries are a sodium-free,
          fat-free, cholesterol-free, low-calorie food.`,
    para3: `They are among the top 20 fruits in antioxidant capacity and are a good
        source of manganese and potassium. Just one serving -- about eight
        strawberries -- provides more vitamin C than an orange.`,

    para1: `A healthy breakfast helps you control your weight and blood sugar and gives you nutrients that help your growth and development, along with your sense of well being. A bad breakfast has other plans: It messes with your metabolism and may cause weight gain. `,
    para2: `There's a big difference between a bowl of berries and a biscuit covered with sausage gravy. Break your nightly fast with healthy foods and start your day off strong.`,
    para3: `Prep tip: If you don't have time to stand around and sauté every morning, make a big batch of breakfast tacos a few nights before, freeze them, and reheat as needed.`,

    para1: `Almonds are the edible seeds of Prunus dulcis, more commonly called the almond tree`,
    para2: `Almonds are also high in phytic acid, a substance that binds certain minerals and prevents them from being absorbed. While phytic acid is generally considered a healthy antioxidant, it also slightly reduces the amount of iron, zinc and calcium you get from almonds.`,
    para3: `Almonds are a fantastic source of antioxidants. Antioxidants help protect against oxidative stress, which can damage molecules in your cells and contribute to inflammation, aging and diseases like cancer`,
