          Number One Meals” is born out of curiosity and the need to address the
          mental health issues that prevail today due to the societal pressure
          of looking a certain kind and eating a certain type, called the ‘gram-

          We offer ways like healthy eating blogs, recipes, savory and desserts
          without pressurizing you to eat things which are good for health but
          tough on taste buds. Healthy eating is balanced eating and not the
          kind that is trending today; per say it is morally wrong to publicize
          food items just for the sake of views.
